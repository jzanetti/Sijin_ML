Welcome to Sijin's Machine Learning Tutorial
===================================

This documentation provides an overview about how different machine learning (and deep learning) algorithms work.

The examples used in this documentation are described as *intuitive* as possible. Most materials are adapted from some classic machine learning books including:

* **Deep Learning** (by *I.Goodfellow*, *Y.Bengio* and *A.Courville*)
* **Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow** (by *A.GÃ©ron*)
* **Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython** (by *W.McKinney*)
* **Practical Statistics for Data Scientists: 50+ Essential Concepts Using R and Python** (by *P.Bruce*, *A.Bruce* and *P.Gedeck*)
* **The StatQuest Illustrated Guide to Machine Learning** (by *J.Starmer*)
