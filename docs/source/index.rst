Welcome to Sijin's Machine Learning Notes
===================================

This page contains the notes about different machine learning algorithms from my daily work.

The examples used in this documentation are mostly adapted from classic machine learning books including:

* **Deep Learning** (by *I.Goodfellow*, *Y.Bengio* and *A.Courville*)
* **Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow** (by *A.GÃ©ron*)
* **Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython** (by *W.McKinney*)
* **The StatQuest Illustrated Guide to Machine Learning** (by *J.Starmer*)
* **Practical Statistics for Data Scientists: 50+ Essential Concepts Using R and Python** (by *P.Bruce*, *A.Bruce* and *P.Gedeck*)

Ideas from many other online public-faced resources are also borrowed (apologises that I am not able to list all of them here).

Compared to most machine learning handbooks, only the methods used in my work are collected here, and I tried my best to use the most intuitive examples to explain the processes of different machine learning algorithms (by avoiding the use of complicated mathmatical equations ...).
