Welcome to Sijin's Machine Learning Notes
===================================

Welcome to my page where I share notes on various machine learning algorithms that I encounter in my daily work. 

The examples provided here draw mostly from classic machine learning books, which I have adapted to illustrate these algorithms.

* **Deep Learning** (by *I.Goodfellow*, *Y.Bengio* and *A.Courville*)
* **Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow** (by *A.GÃ©ron*)
* **Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython** (by *W.McKinney*)
* **The StatQuest Illustrated Guide to Machine Learning** (by *J.Starmer*)
* **Practical Statistics for Data Scientists: 50+ Essential Concepts Using R and Python** (by *P.Bruce*, *A.Bruce* and *P.Gedeck*)

Please note that ideas from various online resources have been utilized in creating these notes, and while I regret that I cannot list all of them here, I am grateful for their contributions.

Unlike many machine learning handbooks, this collection focuses solely on the methods that I have used in my work. My goal is to provide intuitive explanations of the different machine learning algorithms, using examples that are easy to understand and avoiding complicated mathematical equations as much as possible.
