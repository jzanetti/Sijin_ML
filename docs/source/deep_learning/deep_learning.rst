Neural network
=====

A **neural network** is a series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates. In this sense, neural networks refer to systems of neurons, either organic or artificial in nature.

Neural Network or Artificial Neural Network is one set of algorithms used in machine learning for modeling the data using graphs of Neurons.
