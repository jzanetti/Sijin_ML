Ensemble method
=====

In statistics and machine learning, ensemble methods use multiple learning algorithms to obtain better predictive performance than could be obtained from any of the constituent learning algorithms alone. Typical ensemble methods include boosting, bagging and stacking.

In this section, a few examples are given for demostrating the use of ensemble in machine learning

.. note::

   More materials are to be added. Most examples/materials used here are obtained and adpated from internet.
